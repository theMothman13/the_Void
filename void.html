        <p1>Your void is a dedicated space anything you'd like to add to your permanent memory banks, without taking up precious space in your brain. With the massive amounts of entertainment and information, it's hard to keep track of what you've seen or heard before, but no more! An epic movie catch your eye? Check your void to see if you've seen it before, and what your thoughts were. Even check a personal rating averaged out over the times you've seen it. Utilize that biological memory for skills, hobbies, and other, important aspects of life.</p1>
